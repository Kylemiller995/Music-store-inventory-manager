# Music-store-inventory-manager

This was the first project completed for my 16 week intensive coding bootcamp.

It's a RESTful app which implements full CRUD functionality and demonstrates the use of:

Ruby
Sinatra
HTML
CSS
PostgreSQL
TDD

Project Brief:

The owner of Keith's Record Store wants an app which will help him keep on top of his store inventory. He does not want an app that customers will see, but he will use to check stock levels and see what he needs to order soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have an Artist and Album as well as the quantity available.

MVP:
Create albums with the quantity that are in stock
Create artists
Show an inventory page listing albums and artists
Show a stock level for the inventory items e.g. High/Medium/Low
Possible Extensions:
Add a buy and sell price to each stock item
Calculate the possible markup on items and show on inventory page
Add a genre to an Album
